2)	After pressing run the code displays the array size and carries out the search function. This function asks for an integer being searched for and returns its position; both are displayed on the screen. The code then prompts the user for the value they desire to modify and the index position they would like the modification to be done. 
The try and catch code is then implemented for the modification function. If the user enters a position that is out of the scopes or bounds of the array, then an out-of-range error is thrown. After this error is caught, the code is aborted.
Displayed below, the user enters 122 which is greater than the array’s size and as such an error is thrown.

3)	The code then displays the old and new value. The user is prompted to enter the number he or she would like to add to the array. The code expects an integer to be entered, if not the try and catch is implemented for the addition function. 
Display below, the user enters a string “fifteen” and because this is not an integer, the try and catch logic error is thrown and the code is aborted. The error message “Error! Incorrect type” is displayed.
